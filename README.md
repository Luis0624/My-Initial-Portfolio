After copying the ssh/https link open your terminal(MacOS) or Gitbash(Windows) and enter the command git clone "paste link here"
In your file finder open the folder that was created after cloning in the location you chose to clone the repo. Open the folder that was created with VS code(or any code editing program) and you should have the files and images that was used. 

### USAGE

As the portfolio stands now you can check the functionality of the media queries by either of the following methods

* Use the developer tools in the browser
* Or, open the Github pages link on your mobile phone or a tablet.

Using VS code, or your choice of editor feel free to look through the HTML file and the CSS stylesheets. Comments and constructive criticisms are welcome.
